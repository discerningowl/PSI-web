<p align="center" class="style75">Being a ham for over 50 years and a member of the ARRL for most</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">of that time....It is difficult for me to support the ARRL of any of it's programs</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">because of past actions and current proposals they have before the FCC.</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">I worked had for my ticket back in the day....learning the code, studying night after night, </p>
<p align="center" class="style75">and going the FCC office in Atlanta to take my test. It is so easy to get license today </p>
<p align="center" class="style75">by going to a ham cram. I don't like ham crams.</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">If you keep studying and yearning for knowledge after passing a ham cram test that is great.</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">By doing so you are learning theory and rules and regulations. If you never pick up a book again I feel you are going to miss a big part of our wonderful hobby.</p>
<p align="center" class="style75"> Where have the high standards of practice our fraternity adopted</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">and upheld through the years gone?</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">Who am I to say all this?</p>
<p align="center" class="style75"> Just an old timer who doesn't want to see this hobby turn into CB</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">which I think is happening very fast.</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">Seems to me the<br />
  ARRL and producers of radio equipment want the FCC to pass any proposal to lessen</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">quidelines for becoming a ham.....More ARRL memberships and radio producers sell more equipment! It's all about money!</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">Why don't they propose to the FCC to just give away a full priveledge license and callsign in</p>
<p align="center" class="style75">every box of Cracker  Jacks!</p>

<p align="center" class="style75">The Peach State Intertie being one of them!</p>

    <p class="style3"><strong>Ask any hams that you know of   to name one thing that they don't like in ham radio. Most likely that   they will tell you it is &quot;kerchunk&quot;. This happens mainly on 2m FM   repeaters. Kerchunk is when someone presses the PTT button for a short   while, triggering the repeater, but have no intention to talk to anyone.   People who kerchunk are not necessarily those without amateur radio   license, hams also kerchunk the repeater.<br />
        <br />
      The first category are   those who press the PTT when there is no one is talking on the repeater.   They are lonely and they feel good when they hear the repeater's   squelch tail or the courtesy beep. These people are trying to satisfy   themselves. We can equate them to doing masturbation. However, the   different is that when they press the PTT, they disturb other people who   are monitoring. Some hope for kerchunk reply by another fellow   kerchunker. Then, they will exchange kerchunks until one of them   exhausted (their thumbs get tired).<br />
      <br />
      After that, we have another   type of people who kerchunk because they are &quot;shy&quot; or &quot;timid&quot;. So, they   kerchunk as a way to figure out whether their rig is working, and the   repeater is working. It is too troublesome to call for radio check and   to mention their callsigns. Maybe, some secret projects are in progress.   They are doing this only when they do not hear anyone on air. A sub   group of this, are those who test the SWR of their antenna using the   repeater frequency with the tone set as well. This really annoys people.<br />
      <br />
      The   third group consists of those who kerchunk just immediately after   someone tried to make a call. Their intention is to annoy the guy who   try to make a contact. To the guy who made the call, it seems like   someone is trying to reply him but failed. In actual, it was the joker   who kerchunked the repeater. People will try to tell that they are not   accessing the repeater well, and the joker will try to kerchunk again.   They feel good because someone notices their key-up. On the other hand,   some hams will refrain from answering the caller because they are afraid   of being mistaken as kerchunkers.<br />
      <br />
      The more annoying one will be   those who make a key-up during the 3-second pause between QSO. This   creates an impression that someone is trying to break into the QSO, or   trying to join the QSO. It really disrupts the smoothness of the   communication. Most hams are courteous enough to give breakers the   priority. However, these cowards are misusing the chance given to them.<br />
      <br />
      Besides   those who kerchunk, there are also jammers. This group will just PTT   whenever they like. Some feels good when they managed to jam someone's   transmission. They do this as some kind of &quot;revenge&quot;. Besides, some   jammers are pressing the PTT to purposely jam others when they don't   want something to be known to other hams.</strong></p>
    <p class="style3"><strong><br />
      Someday,   we can organize a kerchunk day (like a field day), and have the public   to kerchunk the repeater as well. Another idea is to use repeater   kerchunking as a 2 wpm CW. Maybe it could be a good idea to have the   Kerchunk All Continent award, or KCC (kerchunked 200 repeaters) award as   well. Haha... just kidding.<br />

<p align="center" class="style2"><strong>Proper Phonetics Please!</strong></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong> I wish that amateurs would always use the accepted ITU approved phonetic alphabet when phonetics are used. Hams in all countries generally understand the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) phonetic alphabet. It is used when signing your call or passing information that must be spelled out.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>The ITU adopted the NATO phonetic alphabet developed in the 1950s to be intelligible and pronounceable, and is generally understood by all amateur radio operators around the world. It has a long history of working very well in harsh phone conditions.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>My callsign phonetically is Whiskey Bravo Four November Foxtrot Golf.  If conditions are rough, I'll repeat it phonetically several times. ALL amateurs should KNOW those phonetics, and in my experience they DO! It corrects any misunderstandings very rapidly. If using those phonetics do not clear up a misheard letter, then the conditions are just not favorable for a phone contact.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>My callsign phonetically is NOT Willie Baker Four Nice Fine Guy. Whether you are in Indiana or India, as an amateur radio operator (or any voice communications type person) you will understand the ITU phonetic alphabet.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>It's a pet peeve of mine. You will all do what you will, but I know it is much more impressive and I consider it to be GOOD OPERATING </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>PRATICE to use the ITU phonetic alphabet.</strong></p>

      <p> The traditional expression &quot;73&quot; goes right back to the beginning of   the landline telegraph days. It is found in some of the earliest   editions of the numerical codes, each with a different definition, but   each with the same idea in mind--it indicated that the end, or   signature, was coming up. But there are no data to prove that any of   these were used.<br />
      </p>
      <p>The first authentic use of 73 is in the publication The National   Telegraph Review and Operators' Guide, first published in April 1857. At   that time, 73 meant &quot;My love to you!&quot; Succeeding issues of this   publication continued to use this definition of the term. Curiously   enough, some of the other numerals then used have the same definition   now that they had then, but within a short time, the use of 73 began to   change.<br />
      </p>
      <p>In the National Telegraph Convention, the numeral was changed from   the Valentine-type sentiment to a vague sign of fraternalism. Here, 73   was a greeting, a friendly &quot;word&quot; between operators and it was so used   on all wires.<br />
      </p>
      <p>In 1859, the Western Union Company set up the standard &quot;92 Code&quot;. A   list of numerals from one to 92 was compiled to indicate a series of   prepared phrases for use by the operators on the wires. Here, in the 92   Code, 73 changes from a fraternal sign to a very flowery &quot;accept my   compliments,&quot; which was in keeping with the florid language of that era.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Over the years from 1859 to 1900, the many manuals of telegraphy show  variations of this meaning. Dodge's <em>The Telegraph Instructor</em> shows it  merely as &quot;compliments.&quot;<em> The Twentieth Century Manual of Railway and  Commercial Telegraphy</em> defines it two ways, one listing as &quot;my compliments to you;&quot; but in the   glossary of abbreviations it is merely &quot;compliments.&quot; Theodore A.   Edison's <em>Telegraphy Self-Taught</em> shows a return to &quot;accept my   compliments.&quot; By 1908, however, a later edition of the Dodge Manual   gives us today's definition of &quot;best regards&quot; with a backward look at   the older meaning in another part of the work where it also lists it as   &quot;compliments.&quot;<br />
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Best regards&quot; has remained ever since as the   &quot;put-it-down-in-black-and-white&quot; meaning of 73 but it has acquired   overtones of much warmer meaning. Today, amateurs use it more in the   manner that James Reid had intended that it be used --a &quot;friendly word   between operators.&quot; </p>
